**History**

- 1960s: U.S. Department of Defense created ARPANET to connect research computers for communication during emergencies.
- 1983: Scientists adopted TCP/IP Standards
- 1991: Tim Berners-Lee introduced the World Wide Web

## Network Topologies

Network topology is the arrangement (physical or logical layout) of computers, devices, and connections in a network.
It shows how nodes are connected and how data flows between them.

## Network Communication Types

- Unicast: 1 → 1
- Broadcast: 1 → All
- Multicast: 1 → Many
- Anycast: 1 → One of Many

## Network Parameters
